        	<h2>IT ALL STARTS WITH A GREAT DOMAIN</h2>
            <h3>Shared Hosting</h3>
            <p>
            	The most obvious advantage of shared hosting is the low price. For smaller, newer sites, shared hosting is typically the most optimal since it is the least expensive 
            	and still provides an ample amount of bandwidth, power, and memory. You pay for what you actually need, rather than sinking in more money for bandwidth or memory you be 
            	unlikely to require. Your shared web hosting with Domain.com is managed by skilled experts. They focus on maintaining server health, leaving you the time to focus on your business. 
            	This labor specialization also increases your efficiency.
            </p>
            <h3>VPS Hosting</h3>
            <p>
            	Domain VPS is an ideal balance between cost paid and benefits received. In many ways, you have the benefits of a dedicated server, but at a portion of the cost. 
            	 VPS allows you to have your chosen operating system as well as server applications. You can alter these applications, or services, or make any changes you see fit. This gives you 
            	 a completely custom VPS hosting experience, providing you with the flexibility you need. On a VPS server, you have a dedicated amount of CPU time, memory, ram, and bandwidth. 
            	 Since your operating system is your own, no domains on your server can possibly access your information, data, or files. This protects your domain and provides peace of mind that 
            	 your important information is safe.
            </p>
