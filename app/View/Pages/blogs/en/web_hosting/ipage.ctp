            <h3>Shared Hosting</h3>
            <p>
            	iPage offers the cheapest shared hosting price, just AUD $1.99 per month. It contains unlimited disk space, unlimited MySQL databases, free SSL certificate
            	and one free domain for a year. It also provides free email addresses. If you think that WebMail space is too low, using the free email forwarding service to
            	save email in other email box, like Outlook or Gmail. One click install is another attractive feature. It allows you to install CMS systems (like Wordpress,
            	Drupal, joomla, etc),  Blogs (like Wordpress, PixelPost, b2evolution, etc), photo galleries (like Gallery2, ZenPhoto, etc), forums (like Gbook, phpBB, SMF, etc)
            	and online stores (like AgoraCart, OpenCart, OSCommerce, PrestaShop, Zen Cart and TomatoCart ). 
            </p>
            <h3>VPS Hosting</h3>
            <p>
            	The basic plan is just AUD $19.99 per month. That is definitely a good price for advanced users. If you expect high traffic volumes, or have specific compliance 
            	requirements that prevent you from using shared servers, these are good options to consider, especially if you don't want to pay dedicated web hosting's relatively 
            	high prices.
            </p>
            <h3>Dedicated Hosting Plans</h3>
            <p>
            	This is the plan which gives you more flexibility, but the price is also higher than the other plans. It starts up at AUD 119.99 per month. 5TB bandwidth, 2 Core CPU,
            	and 4GB of RAM is enough to support a medium level ecommerce website. If you want to go crazy, you cna get 15TB bandwidth, 4 Core CPU, and 16GB of RAM.
            </p>
            <h3>Wordpress Hosting</h3>
            <p>
            	Like many of its competitors, iPage offers WordPress hosting, too. They recently lower the price to just AUD $7.49. That is very competitive price and it will
            	make you hard to believe. The plan also includes 1 year free domain registration, Unlimited storage, Unlimited bandwidth and Pre-installed themes & plugins. This 
            	is suitable for beginners. You won't need to worry about anything. iPage has done all of them for you. You only need to click once and you will get what you want.
            </p>
            <h3>Web Development Support</h3>
            <p>
            	The one click install feature could be the best one you can have in the web hosting world. iPage has 1000+ templates for all major CMS systems. So build a Wordpress
            	website, choose iPage. And you will also have vDeck or cPanel control panel in all plans. 
            </p>
