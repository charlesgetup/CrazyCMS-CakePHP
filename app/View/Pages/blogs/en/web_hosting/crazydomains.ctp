            <h3>Shared Hosting</h3>
            <p>
            	One major advantage of CrazyDomains Web Hosting solutions is the extensive usage of SSD memory in server arrays. SSD, or Solid State Drives, is the latest-generation 
            	type of computer memory. Instead of storing information on a rotating disk (like older-model hard drives), this memory is in a drive that stores information 
            	magnetically in a non-spinning model. Because there is no laser that searches for the information on the disk, SSD memory loads up to 300% faster than traditional 
            	hard disks.
            </p>
            <p>
            	cPanel, one click install app, FTp, emails and even DDos protection are all supported by this cheap shared web host plan. 
            </p>
