            <h2>Live chat - An all-in-one solution of online marketing</h2>
            <h3>What is live chat?</h3>
            <p>
            	Live chat is an online customer service system with live support, help desk software, and web analytics capabilities.
            </p>
            <h3>What benefits can live chat provide?</h3>
            <p class="title">
            	1. Immediate Contact
            </p>
            <p>
            	Responding faster to a lead or a potential customer is going to leave a better impression than making new customers (or any customers) wait around. According
            	to the study, there was a 10x decrease in the odds of making contact with a lead after just five minutes without a response. Waiting more than 15 minutes to 
            	respond meant losing nearly all of your potential leads.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Why? Because in today’s fast-paced world, people just don’t want to wait for a response.
            </p>
            <p>
            	To avoid this awkward situation, CrazySoft released their unique designed live chat system. It may costs you 5 minutes to install, but it will help you response
            	immediately.
            </p>
            <p class="title">
            	2. Personalized Service
            </p>
            <p>
            	Direct communications with a company’s support department are more valuable to a customer. Talking in real time gives the customer the feeling that the business 
            	cares and that is something businesses can’t get with canned email responses. Chatting with a company representative encourages future purchasing decisions and 
            	allows the representative to ask questions and properly assist the customer.
            </p>

            	something else while waiting.
