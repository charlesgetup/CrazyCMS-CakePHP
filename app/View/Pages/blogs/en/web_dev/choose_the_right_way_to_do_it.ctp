            <h2>How to choose the right way to develop website</h2>
            <h3>Do I need a website?</h3>
            <p>
            	This sounds like a dummy question. But I am sure that some people will say no, I don't need it. Mobile app is better than the website. From the customer point
            	of view, this may be right. Nowadays, more and more people are using smart phones and mobile app is no doult the trand of how to display things. But from the
            	business owner point of view, even you already have a mobile app, you still need a system to manage the app content, your customers, products and so on. And that
            	is a website.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
            	Generally speaking, thre are two major web development methods.
            </p>
            <ul>
           		<li>Based on Frameworks or CMS systems to do second development</li>
           		<li>Developing from scratch</li>
           	</ul>
            <p>
            	Developing from scratch is the way we do 10 - 15 years ago. That kind of development gives developers enough space to create new functions and new logics. At that time, 
            	to be a programmer (Web was not that popular at that time, we call ourselves programmers.) is very hard. We need to build functions to generate dynamic web pages,
            	manually retrieve data from database, make our own ways to secure the form and so on. 
            </p>	
            <p>
            	Although some large companies still develop their system using this way, lots and lots of small & medium level companies switch to Frameworks or CMS systems. And the 
            	reason is very obvious. They have no need to build the system so complex. They need to shorten development time, simplify development cycles and reduce costs. So in this 
            	article, I will mainly talk about development online applications using Frameworks or CMS systems.
            </p>
            <h3>Frameworks or CMS systems</h3>
            <p>
            	When talk about this, people may think of Wordpress, Drupal or Magento. But those are CMS (Content Manage System) to us, because those systems are working websites,
            	after installation, you have no need to do anything and it just works. All you need to do is put the content in. But the framework is a lower level implementation of 
            	the website. They only provide bottom level functionalities and you need to build the web services and web page design by yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Now we know the differences, and how to use them is also obvious. If you only want one simple function to work, like I want to sell my product online. I will choose
            	Magento, the CMS system. If you want to have more complexs or special functionalities, like an online game platform or a photo editor, Framework is the best choice.
            	And like I said above, for most business owners, they don't have enough time and money to build a complex system, so CMS systems are leading today's web development trend.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Then some people may ask that if the CMS is so perfect and it is a working website, why I still need a web developer invole? I can build the website by myself.
            	Here I have 3 points to mention, then you can decide whether you want to do it or not. 
            </p>
            <ul>
            	<li>
            		<strong>CMS is not just one piece.</strong> 
            		It includes source code, database and graphic designs. Without web developing technology, it is very hard to install the website like what it is demoed.
            	</li>
            	<li>
            		<strong>Customise the general look and feel.</strong> 
            		The CMS system usually contains some basic design of the website. But those are too simple. Compare to the morden graphic design, I don't think anyone can just use
            		the default design. Some one may say that I can buy a template online. Of course, companies like Template Monster and EnvatoMarket, sell all knids of templates
            		for different CMS. But like I said above, install the template in the existing wbsiete is not that easy. And another important problem is everyone can purchase
            		the same template. If your website looks the same as the another 100 websites, it is hard to attract people. 
            	</li>
            	<li>
            		<strong>Adding more service to CMS.</strong> 
            		CMS only help you to accomplish one goal, how about the others? For example, I have an online store to sell clothes. I want to allow our Chinese customer to use
            		WeChat pay, but Magento didn't have that option. What should I do? Download or buy a plugin or extension, some people said. That is corrrect, but not 100% correct. Plugin or extension
            		developers can only provide general functionalities, like the CMS, those applications online are for everyone, not just for you. If the plugin can do 80%
            		of your job, you have to beg the developer to add the functions you need in forum or via email. And this usualy cost you days and weeks to get a reply like "The function
            		you asked for is not supported." So customise existing plugin and develop dedicated plugin is another job that the developers need to do.   
            	</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            	So you still want to build a website all by yourself? If you answer is yes, congratulations, you have all the technology on hand, just do it. But most people may say no. If that is
            	your answer, you need to find a profession company to help you. CrazySoft could be one of the best. Go to the website and see what they can do and what they already done.
